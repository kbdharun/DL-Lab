# Deep Learning Lab Programs

[![Open in Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/kbdharun/DL-Lab)

This repository contains the programs that I worked out in Deep Learning Essentials Laboratory.

## Prerequisites

Python and packages in `requirements.txt` file installed.

> [!NOTE]
> You can install all the required packages using the command `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Working with Conda

If you are using `conda` to manage your environments, you can create a new environment for this repository with the command `conda create -n ml-lab` and activate it with the command `conda activate ml-lab`.

> [!TIP]
> For faster environment solving in Conda, I would suggesting using the `libmamba` solver. You can set it as the default solver using the command `conda config --set solver libmamba`.

Then, you can install all the required packages using the command `conda install --file requirements.txt`.
